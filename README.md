# Function Approximation using Least Squares Method

A Java application that implements the **Least Squares Approximation** method to approximate a function based on a given set of data points. The program computes the best-fitting line (or polynomial) that minimizes the sum of squared errors between the given points and the approximation.

## Features
- Implements the Least Squares method for linear approximation.
- Accepts user-defined data points as input.
- Calculates coefficients of the best-fitting line.
- Outputs the approximation equation and displays the sum of squared errors.

## About
This project was created as part of my academic work focused on **Numerical Methods** and data approximation techniques. The program demonstrates practical implementation of one of the fundamental algorithms in curve fitting and statistical modeling.
